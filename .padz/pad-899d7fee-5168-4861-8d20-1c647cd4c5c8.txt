Rust Loc for Git Diffs

We will add a new feature to rustloc, a semantically aware loc counter between two git commits.
Something like: 


rustloc diff hash1 hash 2

for example: 

rustloc diff HEAD..main


a few pointers: 
- the feature should allow for all the options (create, filters )  that rustloc already has.
- You will do the pure core application logic work on the rustlocapp crate together with its full tests., not the cli  end. 


before starting: 
  - how should we handle the git integration (for generating the diff? ) what is your recommendation.
  - we dont't need to diff the lines as regular diffs, just output the information aggregating code, tests, comments, blanks (for files / creates, etc as the command call has been done)
  - How easy is it to use our current code to calculate the diff?
